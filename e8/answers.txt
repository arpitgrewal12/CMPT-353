Answer1:
The model that worked best for my colour-prediction file was the KNN Classifier(After running the code many times because KNN and Rand Forests were giving comparable results). Yes, because it does not use assumptions like the normal distribution and independence ( as in Naive Bayesian Classifier) and it takes extra parameters (which we can change to avoid overfitting).I used RGB/LAB since I used it in the last assignment.LAB give better results as RGB colors are not particularly related to human perception but LAB colors are.Conversion to mpre semantically meaning values give better results( Lecture Notes). 

Answer2.The model is making reasonable mistakes because out of almost 1200 values, around 60 values are having the wrong predictions. The reason can be because some of the city data might have similar characteristics and since the training data(which is a subset of the given data) is used to train the classifier ,not all the values can be predicted correctly.Features that we can add can include: sunrise,sunset,humidity etc.
